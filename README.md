The aim of this project is to analyze the determinants of the number of olympics medals won by countries. Given the data structure, the Tobit model for panel data was used, which allows to take into account countries heterogeneity. Results suggests that the most important factors which are possitevely associated with success at the olympics are countries population and the host effect. Regional differences are also important. One supprising result is that GDP per capita was not significant.
